# Calculus-Calculator #
I learn by doing and got tired of the tedious calculations involved in these content sections of my Calculus II course.  Additionally, I use Python to solve complex problems in my work as an analyst and data scientist. Python coding for work is not condusive to public use in a portfolio, but the enclosed set of functions can help demonstrate my abilities to potential clients or emloyers.

Math is useful when it is applied. I hope you enjoy this application.

## First order differential equations ##
The included notebook contains functions for solving first order differential equations, specifically creating approximate solutions using Euler's method, in addition to a function for Newton's Law of Cooling.

## Sequences and Series ##
The second portion of the notebook includes functions for creating tables of values for sequences, and partial sums used in series.  With both functions, you can experiment with a start and stop value to approximate limits, if they exist.
